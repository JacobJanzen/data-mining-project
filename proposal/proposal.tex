Group 01:

Canadian census data is a wealth of information providing crucial insight into everyday
Canadians' characteristics. It has many opportunities to be mined to find
and associate attributes of the population in interesting ways. Our group decided to use
\href{

}{census data}\footnote{
https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/dp-pd/index-eng.cfm
}
in tandem with
\href{
    https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=rep/off/44gedata&document=bypro&lang=e
}{Canadian election data}\footnote{\tiny{
    https://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res\&dir=rep/off/44gedata\&document=bypro\&lang=e
}}
to find correlations between population characteristics, then use these correlations to
create a predictive model of how these demographics vote. We are pursuing decision
trees as our primary tool to analyze the data and find association rules.
